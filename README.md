A very simple and sleek personal website hosted through GitHub Pages using a custom domain name. The site is built using HTML and CSS, fonts are packed directly into the site so they can be provided along with the HTML and CSS. SVGs have been added directly into the HTML to reduce page paint time and simplify the CSS for changing SVG color when hovering over SVG link icons.
