### Who am I?
Hello, my name is Nils Streedain. I am a Student from Portland Oregon. I spend a lot of time working on open source projects from coding to [3D modeling](https://www.printables.com/social/1142-nilsstreedain/about). I am currently studying Computer Science with a focus on Cyber Security at Oregon State University.
